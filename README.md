# N64 Arduino Stuff

Just messing about with an N64 controller. Based on [this code](http://www.instructables.com/id/Use-an-Arduino-with-an-N64-controller/).

Connect up the N64 controller; ```A``` turns the LED on, holding ```Z``` and moving the analog stick makes sweet, sweet music.

Will make it more interesting later (and want to move the N64 code to a library or something).
